 * deleter function.
 *
 * This assumes the caller owns the cookie before calling this function, and
 * does not own the cookie after calling this function.
 *
 * In particular, to use the same cookie in multiple
 * ANpuManager_AllocRequest objects, or in OnPreempt() to reuse the cookie in a
 * new ANpuManager_AllocRequest object, reference count the cookie, and:
 *
 * - Before calling setCookie(), increment the reference count by 1.
 * - In the deleter function, decrement the reference count by 1.
 *
 * # Calling the deleter function
 *
 * When ANpuManager decides to free the cookie:
 * - If cookieDeleter is not NULL, it will be called with the cookie value.
 *   This will happen even if the cookie is NULL. In this case, the deleter
 *   must be able to handle NULL gracefully.
 * - If the cookieDeleter is NULL, nothing will happen, even when the cookie
 *   is not NULL. This is useful if the user stores an arbitrary 64-bit integer
 *   value in the cookie (so it is not a real pointer.) However, if the cookie
 *   points to a heap object, it is strongly recommended to set the deleter
 *   so ANpuManager handles its lifetime properly and reduce UAF bugs.
 *
 * # Other semantics of setCookie()
 *
 * When setCookie() is called multiple times, the previous cookie will be
 * deleted with the previous deleter function (if set) before the new cookie and
 * the new deleter function are set.
 *
 * To clear the cookie, set both cookie and cookieDeleter to NULL.
 *
 * If never called, the default cookie and cookieDeleter are NULL.
 *
 * The deleter may be called from any thread. The user is responsible for
 * deleting the cookie or decrementing the associated reference counts in a thread-safe
 * manner.
